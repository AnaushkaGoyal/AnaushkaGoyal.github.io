        <p class="p">
          The Camp de Tarragona Studio at the University of Pennsylvania examined how the cities of Tarragona, Reus,
          and Salou can grow more cohesively in response to transit investment, industrial land, tourism pressure,
          and increasing climate vulnerability. Anchored around the proposed TramCamp light rail and a new station
          area near Tarragona, the studio focused on reconnecting a fragmented metropolitan landscape.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Within this broader regional framework, this project addresses a central question: how can new housing growth
          align with transit access, environmental risk, and long-term affordability?
        </p>

        <div class="sectionTitle">Project Details — Data-Driven Housing Strategy</div>
        <p class="p">
          This project develops a Data-Driven Housing Policy for the proposed Tarragona station area, using spatial
          analysis to determine where housing should grow, where it should adapt, and where it should be limited.
          Instead of separating housing targets from environmental constraints, the strategy integrates risk,
          accessibility, and development potential into one coherent framework.
        </p>

        <div class="sectionTitle">Core Framework</div>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Creation of a Housing–Environment Opportunity Index applied across a 1-hectare grid</li>
          <li>Integration of flood risk and sea-level rise exposure</li>
          <li>Measurement of transit accessibility and development capacity</li>
          <li>Normalization and weighted scoring (0–1 scale) to allow comparability</li>
          <li>Production of a composite opportunity map guiding growth decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sectionTitle">Spatial Strategy</div>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><b>Zone 1 – Climate Sensitive:</b> Low-rise, adaptive housing in higher-risk areas</li>
          <li><b>Zone 2 – Transitional:</b> Mid-rise infill balancing resilience and moderate density</li>
          <li><b>Zone 3 – Transit-Oriented:</b> Higher-density mixed-use development within walking distance of the proposed station</li>
          <li>Density gradients aligned with environmental safety and accessibility</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sectionTitle">Policy Outcomes</div>
        <p class="p">
          The framework establishes a clear relationship between risk, transit access, and housing intensity. Higher
          densities are directed to low-risk, well-connected land, while climate-sensitive areas require adaptive
          building standards such as elevated ground floors and permeable landscapes. Development is phased to prioritize
          safer zones first, reducing long-term exposure to environmental hazards.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Mixed-income housing requirements are embedded across all zones to maintain affordability as growth occurs.
          Together, the strategy converts complex spatial data into actionable zoning logic, resilience guidelines, and
          an implementable housing policy roadmap.
