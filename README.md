# **Anaushka Goyal**

Hi there! I’m Anaushka, a Master of City Planning student at the University of Pennsylvania with a concentration in **Urban Spatial Analytics / Smart Cities**.  

With a background in **architecture, urban research, and data analytics**, I explore how cities can use technology and design to become more sustainable, equitable, and efficient.  

My work often combines **GIS, R, Python, and SQL** to analyze spatial data, forecast urban development, and design interactive visualizations.  
I’m especially interested in **real estate analytics, zoning research, and urban tech**—bridging the gap between planning practice and data-driven decision making.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy designing infographics, building interactive dashboards, and experimenting with creative mapping inspired by historic and artistic visual styles.  
My long-term goal: to innovate at the intersection of **urban planning, data science, and technology**, shaping smarter cities and communities.
